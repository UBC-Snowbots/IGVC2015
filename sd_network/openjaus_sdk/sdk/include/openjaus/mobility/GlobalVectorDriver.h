/// <dt>%GlobalVectorDriver Service</dt>
/// <dd><p>
/// The function of the Global Vector Driver is to perform closed loop control of the desired global heading, altitude
/// and speed of a mobile platform. The Global Vector Driver takes the desired heading of the platform as measured with
/// respect to the global coordinate system and the desired speed of the platform. The desired heading angle is defined
/// in a right hand sense about the Z axis of the global coordinate system (the Z axis points downward) where North is
/// defined as zero degrees. The desired Altitude, measured in accordance with the WGS 84 standard, provides a means
/// through which systems capable of flight can be controlled. For ground-based systems, the Altitude field is ignored.
/// The Global Vector Driver also receives data from the Global Pose Sensor and the Velocity State Sensor. This
/// information allows the Global Vector Driver to perform closed loop control on the platformâ€™s global heading,
/// altitude and speed.
