/// \brief ReportManipulatorSpecifications Message Implementation.
/// This message provides the specification of the manipulator including the number of joints, the link length and twist
/// angle of each link, the joint offset (for revolute joints) or joint angle (for prismatic joints), the minimum and
/// maximum value for each joint, and the minimum and maximum speed for each joint. The record
/// ManipulatorCoordinateSystemRec establishes the position and orientation relationship of the manipulator base
/// coordinate system to the vehicle coordinate system. It specifies the location (x,y,z) and orientation (described by
/// the quaternion) of the manipulator coordinate system relative to the base coordinate system.  The variant
/// FirstJointParameters specifies the offset distance from the origin of the manipulator coordinate system to the first
/// link axis (L1 in Figure 1) or the joint angle between the x-axis of the manipulator coordinate system and the line
/// along the first link (Ï†1 in Figure 1), depending on whether the first joint in JointSpecificationList is revolute or
/// prismatic.  The record RevoluteJointSpecificationRec specifies the link length and twist angle for a link and the
/// joint offset for the revolute joint that comes after the link.  The record PrismaticJointSpecificationRec specifies
/// the link length and twist angle for a link and the joint angle for the prismatic joint that comes after the link.
/// The order in which the joints are encoded into the list called JointSpecificationList must correspond with the order
/// of the joints from the manipulator base to the end effector.
