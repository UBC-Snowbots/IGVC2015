/// <dt>%LocalVectorDriver Service</dt>
/// <dd><p>
/// The Local Vector Driver performs closed loop control of the desired local heading, pitch, roll and speed of a mobile
/// platform. The Local Vector Driver is very similar in function to the Global Vector Driver, the difference being that
/// the desired heading is defined in terms of a local coordinate system as opposed to the global coordinate system. The
/// Local Vector Driver takes as input four pieces of information, i.e. the desired heading, pitch and roll of the
/// platform as measured with respect to a local coordinate system and the desired speed of the platform. The desired
/// heading angle is defined in a right hand sense about the Z axis of the local coordinate system where zero degrees
/// defines a heading that is parallel to the X axis of the local coordinate system. The pitch is the angle about the
/// Y-axis and the roll is the desired angle about the X-axis. The Local Vector Driver also receives data from the Local
/// Pose Sensor and the Velocity State Sensor component. This information allows the Local Vector Driver to perform
/// closed loop control on both the platformâ€™s local orientation and speed.
